# Sonnet

Decided to see if I could make an automated botnet using nothing more than shodan and the info from this article. Thanks to security bits for the [neat article](https://security-bits.de/posts/2018/11/11/exposed_sonos_interface.html).

Total POC and NOT actually functioning, but hopefully it'll get Sonos to see just how much of a mistake they've made.

## Legal Stuff

Before you ask, no, I don't plan on using this myself, I made this purely for research and learning purposes, and I am not liable for any damage done using this tool.

## Begging

Sonos. For the love of god. Please. Do not put a ping tool, outward facing with no auth, on your speakers. Why???
